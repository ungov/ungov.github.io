The decisions government takes on our behalf are hugely important. Modern government is tired, and when confronted by vested interests, bureaucratic inertia and the tabloid media, too often puts the easy thing to do ahead of the right thing to do.

But talk to people privately about the work they do - be it in government, in business or in civil society - and you'll find that most have a clear idea about how government policy can be improved.

We think the country can't afford to let these insights go unnoticed. So we're building a safe space for people in the know to get their ideas into the open, and for everyone to join in the debate and help change government policy for the better.

### Our principles

This is an independent project with no party political affiliation.

We're most interested in policy ideas that:

- Fix market failures
- Eliminate rent seeking
- Empower people and communities
- Respect future generations
- Recognise our global responsibilities

We think the best way to open up a debate is to make it safe for people in the know to share their point of view, so if you send us an idea then we will keep your identity private. 

We are making everything else as transparent as possible, and you can always [talk to us](/contact/).

### The team

Ungov is run by [Chris](https://twitter.com/clry2) and [Sophia](https://twitter.com/sophia_oliver). Between us we have over 20 yearsâ€™ experience in the policy world, and have spent time working both inside and outside government.
