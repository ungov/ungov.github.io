This is where you tell us how government policy can be improved.

All you need is an idea that makes sense.

Send it to us by email at [policy@ungov.uk](mailto:policy@ungov.uk) or use our <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/yiu.co.uk/forms/d/1fcFKFqExIyz84Eez-rr452zD78j1qoOzg0mD4ofqt_k/viewform" target="_blank">online form</a>.

#### What we're looking for

- We're looking for simple, radical ideas that you think the people in power ought to consider.
- It will help if you can set out clearly what problem you have identified and how you think it can be solved (take a look at the [policy library](/library/) to see how other people have approached things).
- Don't worry if you haven't worked out all the details, we can help you to do that part.

#### What happens next

- We'll read your submission as soon as possible, and then get in touch with you to talk about it and make sure we understand where you are coming from.
- Once we have a promising proposal we will add it to the library for the community to review.

#### Keeping submissions anonymous

- We need to know who you are to help us vet your submission, but we won't ever tell anyone else that you have contacted us.
- Every proposal that we add to the library is anonymous.

#### A word of advice

- We really want to hear your ideas, but we’re not interested in political point scoring and we definitely don’t want you to divulge state secrets. The [Ministerial Code](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ministerial-code) and [Civil Service Code](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code) are important; please respect them.
