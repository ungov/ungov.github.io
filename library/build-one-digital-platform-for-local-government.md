There are [over 400 local authorities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_make-up_of_local_councils_in_the_United_Kingdom) across the UK. Whilst all of them have a unique history and population to serve, many of the day-to-day functions they carry out are the same. Whether you live in Warwick or Watford, the bins need to get collected, planning applications need to get reviewed, and potholes need to get fixed. And, of course, you need to pay your [Council Tax](https://www.gov.uk/council-tax) on time.

Although councils have lots in common, they are all doing their own thing when it comes to the internet. Each has taken its own approach to building a website, and has its own idiosyncratic procedures for citizens to follow. This is far from ideal: dealing with your council online is easy for some people and hard for others, and building so many websites to do basically the same thing is a colossal waste of time and money.

The UK government has taken a hard line on central government websites. Forcing them all onto [GOV.UK](http://www.gov.uk) is driving up standards and massively improving things for the everyday user. From an organisational perspective, departments have the flexibility to use the parts of the platform they need, without having to reinvent the underlying infrastructure.

No doubt every council would plead exceptional circumstances, and many a cosy IT department would resist change. But citizens deserve better, and a bonfire of local government websites is long overdue.
