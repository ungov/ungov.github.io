Transport accounts for [around a fifth](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/final-uk-emissions-estimates) of the UK's carbon dioxide emissions. A big part of this is emissions generated by petrol and diesel engines in our cars.

One way to reduce our environmental impact is to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles. Although the immediate effect is often to shift emissions rather than eliminate them (since the electricity required will probably still be generated by burning fossil fuels), they open up a path to a future where surface transport is powered by renewable and / or nuclear energy with zero emissions at the tailpipe and at the point of generation.

For years [commentators have noted](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/20/electric-cars-chicken-and-egg-issue) that widespread take-up of electric vehicles suffers from a classic chicken-and-egg problem: without many electric vehicles on the roads there is little incentive for industry to build a charging network, but without a charging network consumers are reluctant to invest in electric vehicles.

A number of recent developments should make electric vehicles more attractive, including advances in battery technology and charge points, improved [onboard systems designed to reduce range anxiety](http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/model-s-has-you-covered), and [charge clubs](http://chargeyourcar.org.uk/) where people open up their own charging points to other users. The government has also put money behind [grants for electric vehicle purchases](https://www.gov.uk/plug-in-car-van-grants/overview) and [match funding to install charging points](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plugged-in-places), and [a European-backed project](http://rapidchargenetwork.com/about.php) is testing new multi-standard rapid charging points at a number of UK sites.

Nevertheless, the options for rapid charging of electric vehicles are slim compared to traditional petrol stations, both in terms of the number of locations and the average capacity of vehicles per location. Until this problem is solved it seems unlikely that electric vehicles will be a compelling option for most people.

In the meantime, [research conducted by the National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=133947) in the United States has suggested that spending government money on charging infrastructure rather than tax credits for owners could generate five times as many sales of electric vehicles. And in the UK, the fragmentation of existing charging infrastructure is already starting to [run into problems](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/green-motoring/11184799/Londons-electric-car-infrastructure-falling-into-ruin.html).

Government is in unique position to move things forward. By making a significantly increased investment in a national rapid charging network for electric cars we could shift the UK to being the most advanced market in the world for electric vehicles. As well as the long-term environmental benefits this would also be a big a boost for advanced manufacturing and R&D, which in turn would deliver savings for consumers by driving down the cost of electric vehicles.
