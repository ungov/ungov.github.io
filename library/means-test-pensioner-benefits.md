excerpt: Benefits like free TV licences and the winter fuel payment, which are supposed to help the less well off, should not be given to wealthy pensioners.

As well as providing a basic income via the [state pension](https://www.gov.uk/state-pension/overview), and special [high-interest savings bonds](http://www.nsandi.com/65-guaranteed-growth-bonds) for those with cash to invest, Britain also funds a generous set of universal benefits for its pensioners. [Free bus passes](https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-elderly-person-bus-pass), [free TV licences](https://www.gov.uk/free-discount-tv-licence) and the [winter fuel payment](https://www.gov.uk/winter-fuel-payment/overview) together cost the taxpayers [over £3 billion](https://fullfact.org/factchecks/pensioners_benefits_winter_fuel_allowance_bus_pass_tv_license-27560) a year.

All of this has protected many poor pensioners from the worst of the economic downturn. But not all pensioners are poor - far from it. The [top fifth of pensioner couples have an average income of £65,000](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/pensioners-incomes-series-2012-to-2013) (or £75,000 if you also include the state pension payments they are entitled to).

At a time when the government is still seeking to bring balance to the public finances, and with further tax increases and / or spending cuts seemingly inevitable, there is no credible economic case for continuing with universal pensioner benefits. For many well-off pensioners, the winter fuel allowance and its ilk are simply free money to be spent on whatever they please, paid for by everyone else.

Simply abolishing the three main universal pensioner benefits would save several billion pounds a year. If we didn't want to go this far, then an element of means testing could reduce the bill significantly by limiting entitlement to pensioners with incomes below a certain level ([median household earnings](http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/mar/25/uk-incomes-how-salary-compare), say).
