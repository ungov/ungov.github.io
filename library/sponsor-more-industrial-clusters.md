The UK has several world-leading industrial clusters - in industries as diverse as aerospace, oil and gas, financial services and media. All of these have benefited from some degree of state support, be it explicit sponsorship in areas like London's [Tech City](http://www.techcityuk.com), or implicit support via the presence of leading universities or transport infrastructure. Similarly, in the US, [the pivotal role of the government in the development of Silicon Valley](http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/04/the-government-once-built-silicon-valley/) is often underestimated.

There is a real opportunity for the government to make more of its ability to shape [industrial clusters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_agglomeration) in the UK. A more active industrial policy, and greater coordination between our efforts on higher education, infrastructure, planning, taxation and regulation, could provide the anchor for many more successful clusters to form around the country. These need not all be high tech - manufacturing, utilities and a whole range of sectors could benefit. With this focus it would be easier for young people with an aptitude for a particular field to find a community of peers and mentors, and for specialised supply chains to build up around different locations.

Moreover, paired with a sound analysis of the UK's national and regional make-up, this could provide a route to rebalancing our economy away from London and the South East and helping other parts of the country to gain more from growth.

The big risk in this approach is that government tries to pick winners - subsidising particular companies or institutions beyond their economic viability. This would need tight control. As David Willetts and others have put it, government can find ways to [pick which races to compete in](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/speech-by-david-willetts-to-the-uk-science-park-association), without going so far as picking winners.
