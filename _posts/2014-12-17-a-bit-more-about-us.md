Some of you - understandably - want to know who we are. If you don't know much about us then why should you share your ideas with us, or be sure we'll do things properly? We might not be able to address all of that in one go: trust takes a while to build, so we'll get there by being open about what we're doing, and responding if there are things you want to know or suggestions you want to make.

In the meantime, here's a bit more about us...

We have both spent ten years working on policy - at [HM Treasury](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-treasury) (where we met in 2006 working on tax), [No. 10](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/prime-ministers-office-10-downing-street), and the [Cabinet Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/cabinet-office), as well as in business and NGOs. We've also worked across the digital agenda - at the [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service), in think tanks and in the start-up world. You can see what we've been up to on our LinkedIn profiles for [Sophia](http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/sophia-oliver/78/6a9/628/) and [Chris](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/clry2).

We've both been committed to open policymaking and open government while working inside and outside government - see Sophia's [live Q&A on open government for the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/oct/15/live-discussion-open-government-partnership?commentpage=1) while head of transparency at the Cabinet Office, and Chris's [blog on digital participation](http://www.carnegieuktrust.org.uk/blog/july-2014/guest-blog--chris-yiu-asks-where-next-for-digital-) written during his current role as head of digital at [SCVO](http://www.scvo.org.uk). And we've always been advocates for better use of digital and tech to increase participation and improve policymaking.

In the summer this year, we decided that we wanted to turn that experience into something meaningful. We felt that policy and policymaking in the UK wasn't nearly as good as it could be, and that it was overly driven by the press. Plus we'd heard from lots of people that they felt completely disconnected from the policy process, despite having a lot to offer. We wanted to create a properly open platform, for people who know what they're talking about to contribute to the policymaking process - and so started to build [Ungov](/). There's still lots to do, and lots for us to learn, but with your help we hope we can do something to change policy development in the UK for the better.
